## Description

This stage goes through three distinct phases:

1. Understanding the situation
2. Helping those in crisis come to terms with what has happened
3. Helping them to take control, have a plan (What-Next) and are safe in terms of somewhere to stay.

Our goal is to facilitate, support, motivate, provide shelter and give practical advice to achieve phase 3 above. The trap for ER is to take over some of the doing and then have to deal with resulting dependency problems.

## Communication

* Ask the Incident Commander when other responders plan to leave.
* Be prepared for service stand-down (ER not needed).
* Duty-of-care is with CRCC and/or BRC DM – let them know if the call out is potentially a long one.
* If you feel there is a safeguarding issue or if you need advice contact the CRCC as soon as possible.
* If there is something urgent to report that cannot wait you should contact CRCC straight away.

## Field Craft

* As soon as possible and when reasonable encourage the service users doing the work involved in stabilising the situation and drawing up their plan.
* If appropriate use the “What-Next” plan.
* Guide the service users but do not fall into the trap of leading or doing.
* The longer they rely on us the longer it will take to resolve the situation.

## Engaging with service users

* Establish their needs as soon as possible; use questioning technique shown in “Useful Tools” and see also “Engaging & building rapport”.
* Offer resources so that they are more enabled/ comfortable e.g. What-Next plan.
* Check medication needs of service users – if in the property recommend ensure they are not damaged and if so, source from elsewhere.
* Collect contact details from service users and hand over advice booklet.

## Health and Safety

* Put your safety first if the service users’ behaviours put you at risk.
* Make sure you take short breaks, remember to drink and eat.
* If you have to relocate the vehicle make sure you turn off the gas first.
* Keep the vehicle locked if unattended.
* On long call outs plan ahead & contact CRCC to advise if you think you will need a replacement crew.

## CALMER

* Service users will be in shock – consider whole range of emotions from obvious to not so obvious e.g. withdrawn and stating they are OK.
* Work towards getting those in crisis to a point where they have a plan, have taken ownership of the situation and the next steps are clear.
* Enable more than do, other wise there is a risk they become dependant on you.

## Collaboration with other services

* Ensure you ask for ETAs when dealing with organisations such as insurance companies or local authorities.
* Make a note of who you call along with their contact number, role and time of your call.

## Tools, resources and reporting

* Use the What-next-plan form and What-now booklet.
* Keep specific notes of resources used e.g. food, clothing & sizes.
* Keep the vehicle phone with you at all times.
* Keep time logged notes of advice given, actions taken and whom you speak to.

## Looking after you and team work

* Keep each other informed of your location and agree mutual plan/actions.
* Use radios, if available, if you and your partner are out of sight of each other.
* Make sure if you are talking to a service users on your own it must be in view of others e.g. not in an isolated area or in the vehicle with closed doors.

## Press

It’s not uncommon to find the press at an incident. You will need to be careful what you say if they approach you. Stick to the facts with something like “we are providing practical and emotional support to those affected by the incident” If they would like any more info we can put them in touch with the BRC communications duty officer via CRCC.

## Process

### Initial engagement

    * Establish rapport and give emotional support
    * Listen, build trust and start to approach the need to manage the situation
    * Help them to take ownership for what-next

### Manage and enable

    * Encourage them to consider options and support available
    * Review the what-next plan, resources, reassess the situation and prepare to leave
