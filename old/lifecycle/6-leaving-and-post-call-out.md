## Description

The service users are now safe and in control of their own situation, now is the time to leave. They have built a plan (What-Next) and accept responsibility for it.

This stage covers: leaving the incident, en-route back to your home base, and arriving home. It is really important to take care as the highs and lows of the call out will take their toll.

## Communication

* Discuss and agree with CRCC re standing down.
* If CRCC tell you to stand down, you must stand down.  Let the Incident Commander know you are leaving if they are still there.
* Ring CRCC when you are back at your home base at respective times.

## CALMER - Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

* Apply the principles to yourselves, look out for each other.
* Consider going for a coffee or stopping for a bite to eat.
* Have a hot de-brief, talk about the experience and how you feel.
* Chat about what went well and how what you did could have been even better.
* Don't forget the support available for you, see the section ‘Support for you’.
* Remember to capture any thoughts from the de-brief on the incident report form to assist others.

## Field Craft

* Turn on the TomTom and enter the return trip.
* Make the vehicle ready for the next call out – fill up fuel on return if needed (don’t leave under ¾  tank of fuel). Ensure vehicle is fully stocked (empty flasks/dispose of rubbish).
* Turn the mobile phone off and put on charge.
* Turn off the electrics, gas and heating.
* Plug the electricity cable into vehicle.
* Leave the home base as it was when you arrived i.e. was the car park gate open or closed?

## Engaging with those in need

* Take a photo of the “What Next” Plan Text/WhatsApp your ERO during office hours to advise that you attended a call out and add any information that could be useful. Highlight any follow-up actions required by your ERO.
* Do not include names, address or personal details – information security/data protection regs!
* Ensure the service users’ contact details and follow-up help needed are included on the incident report form and post it using the pre-paid envelope.

## Health and Safety

* At your home base keep to the well-lit areas.
* Double check you have turned off the gas on the vehicle before you leave the incident.
* Ask yourself - are you OK to drive home?
* Ensure that any accidents/near misses are entered on the Datix Reporting System found on Red Room.

## Collaboration with other services

* Be quiet as you can when arriving back at your home base, as Fire Fighters maybe sleeping.
* Possible follow-up will be needed with other services e.g. Social Services or Council.
* If you have feedback for another service e.g. Fire, email it to your ERO.

## Tools, resources and reporting

* Take a copy/photo of the What-Next plan.
* Complete the incident report form and process it. Replace the form and call out checklist.
* Complete the mileage sheet and close down checklist before leaving the vehicle.
* Capture any details on the incident report form of how you dealt with the call out that could improve the ER Playbook.

## Looking after you and team work

* If you are called out for a 2nd call out, question if you are OK to respond or ask for another crew if not.
* If you feel you have been affected by the call out then talk to someone for support. See the section Support for you.
* Ensure your grab bag resources are replenished as you might get another call out on your shift.
