# Rota and contact details

## Description

These are pre-duty activities. The rota link will be emailed to you, along with an updated contact sheet, a week or so before the next month. Check your diary to see what shifts you can commit to and enter onto the spread sheet. Also see “Rota commitment ……..” below. The rota is a dynamic document and you can sign up on the day or a day or two before.

## Communication

Update the rota with any changes straight away.  Contact your crew partner before you are on duty.
If you find you are on your own WhatsApp, text or email the team to see if anyone is available, see “Call out situations” opposite.

## CALMER – Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

Ask for help if needed.  Consider personal commitments (are you fit for duty?) and activities you might be doing the day or evening before to ensure your ability whilst on duty will not be compromised.

## Field Craft

## CRCR operational procedure

The Alerting Authority places a request with BRC Crisis Response Contact Centre (CRCC) for BRC ER assistance. CRCC then send out a Flare and or an Assemble request to the nearest operational ER crew to the incident. If no crew responds, further messages will be sent out to adjacent teams teams.  

If no crews are available, CRCC will consider, if appropriate, “Lone Responding” with specifically trained and risk assessed volunteers or telephone support.
