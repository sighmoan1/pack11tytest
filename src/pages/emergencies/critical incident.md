## UK Critical incident management

This procedure outlines how the British Red Cross responds to critical incidents that occur in the UK. It defines what constitutes a critical incident as well as the various responsibilities and activities assigned to staff involved in managing a critical incident. Critical incidents will be managed by a Strategic Group chaired by the Executive Director of UKOps or a UKOps Director nominated by the Executive Director. This procedure follows on from the British Red Cross UK incident reporting policy. It does not cover how incidents are initially reported into the British Red Cross, but outlines how incidents are treated once they are determined as critical.

This procedure is intended to be read in conjunction with the following:

- Psychosocial Resources model & Supporting People Exposed to Intense Events Procedures
- UK Emergencies Guidance
- Serious incidents in UK Operations: reporting and managing
- Incident Reporting Policy
- Procedure for reporting, managing, investigating and learning from serious incidents in UK services

## Definition of a critical incident

Due to the complexity of critical incidents or their impact, some critical incidents are easier to identify than others. British Red Cross recognises a critical incident as:

> Any incident that has caused or has the potential to cause serious harm to British Red Cross people, beneficiaries or customers - or significant disruption to operations that requires extraordinary measures to be applied outside of standard operating procedures in order to effectively manage its impact.

## Roles and responsibilities

### Critical incident strategic (Gold) group

UKMT (or selected members thereof) are the most likely to make up the membership of the Strategic group to manage strategically any critical incident in the UK or involving the PST when deployed abroad. This meeting would be outside of the normal regular UKMT meetings and should, during the incident, be labelled Critical incident strategic group. This group should not contain all UKMT members as a matter of course, the Executive Director of UK Operations is to either chair this meeting or assign a chair and ensure that the appropriate British Red Cross staff/functions are represented.

### Critical incident tactical (Silver) group

This group would also be set up to support an incident and should be chaired by a Director from UKMT, appointed by the Executive Director of UK Operations. This should be the most appropriate Director given the scenario. This Director would also attend the critical incident strategic Group.

A decision will be made by the Executive Director UK Operations in consultation with the CEO, as to whether it is necessary to form members of the ELT as a Strategic Coordination (oversight) Group.

### Critical incident operational (Bronze) group

This group can be set up as appropriate. This would be a local group chaired by a direct line report to the appropriate UKMT Director.

The critical incident operational group would normally be based on the ground and coordinate the response at the operational level. Depending on the critical incident, the relevant service leads will make-up this group. It may comprise of individuals both within the British Red Cross and supporting partners but can be strengthened or replaced by British Red Cross staff deployed from UKO depending on the incident type, context and/or existing capacity.

The benefit of this system is that it maintains a ‘business as usual’ feel and would be the same structure as any emergency. This is how emergencies and therefore critical incidents are best managed.

## UK critical incident management

Whilst critical incidents vary in terms of their nature, intensity, location and scope, common actions can be applied in order to support UKMT decision-making through to its resolution. As such, the British Red Cross divides a critical incident response into the following key stages:

Determine → Convene → Assesses → After action review → Close down → Respond → Aftercare

### Stage 1: Determine

To identify the criticality of a reported incident, British Red Cross assigns an incident (‘traffic light’) level to each reported incident to determine the appropriate level of response required. The table below describes what constitutes each incident (‘traffic light’) level, and the CIM requirements:

|Incident level| Description| Critical incident group (CIG) response|
|---|---|---|
|Green| Incident being managed through standard management procedure with support from British Red Cross H&S| No CIG requirement: follow standard incident / accident reporting procedures. Notify Crisis Response Team|
|Amber| Incident has potential to escalate or may have serious implications to incident party or other British Red Cross staff/operations|Crisis Response Team escalates to relevant Director and Executive Director UKOps for info/action|
|Red| Incident is determined critical from onset or has escalated to a critical stage| Crisis Response Team escalates to relevant Director and Executive Director UKOps for immediate CIG meeting|

The decision around RAG status approval of an incident (“traffic light”) level is made by the CR Team in liaison with the ED UK Ops or appropriate director (in consultation with H&S and HR). Subject to how an incident is developing, the level of response may increase or decrease accordingly.

#### Examples of a Red incident include

- Abduction of British Red Cross staff, volunteers, or associated parties
- An event resulting in death or serious injury to British Red Cross staff, volunteer, service user, beneficiary, or associated parties
- Action by British Red Cross staff or volunteer or associated parties resulting in death or serious injury of a beneficiary or third party

#### Examples of an Amber incident include

- A serious deterioration in security or a specific threat that directly affects the security of British Red Cross staff and volunteers or associated parties
- Arrest or detention of British Red Cross staff, volunteers or associated parties by authorities
- Physical assault or sexual violence against (or by) British Red Cross staff, volunteers or associated parties
- Serious illness affecting British Red Cross staff, volunteers or associated parties that requires urgent medical evacuation
- Any incident that is likely to result in unsolicited and damaging representation in the media
- Volunteer or staff in emergency response fails to check in, after notification to police (see procedure for missing volutneer/staff)

#### Examples of an Green incident include

- Volunteer/staff member fails to check in, prior to notification of police (see procedure for missing staff or volunteer)

### Stage 2: Convene

If an AMBER or RED critical incident has been declared, a Critical Incident Tactical Group (CITG) should be convened. CITG may convene at UKO or remotely so that members can be briefed on the incident details, establish initial response strategies and begin to assign responsibilities or tasks.

An agreement has been established with Facilities, that upon the declaration of a critical incident, the 3rd Floor Large Meeting Room at UKO will be allocated as an Operational Room, superseding any prior room bookings.

### Stage 3: Assess

Once CITG has convened, it is vital for members to fully understand the wider operational context and its potential impact on the critical incident response, including any constraints or barriers that may arise.

To support in making this assessment, CITG will brainstorm the following 4 questions:

- What do you know?
- What do you need to know?
- What has been done?
- What needs to be done?

### Stage 4: Respond

Using the information gathered during the ASSESS stage, CITG will begin developing a detailed response plan. The response plan should:

- Clearly define the objectives and its indicators to monitor implementation
- Assign roles and clarify decision-making authority during the response
- Detail overall coordination, timing and frequency of meetings, updates, reporting requirements, and information sharing requirements or constraints with stakeholders
- Include detailed scenario plans, outlining potential outcomes and any actions associated

### Stage 5: Aftercare

Following a critical incident, it is important to determine the level of support required for both those affected by the incident, and members CITG.

For those affected, post-incident aftercare may include medical treatment, psychological debriefs, long-term psychological support, paid time off, sickness absence, insurance payments and consideration for future deployments/travel.

For members of CITG, post-incident aftercare may include psychological debriefs and additional leave.

### Stage 6: Close down

A decision for the CITG to close and for members to phase back to normal workload will only be authorised by the CITG Chair, and made against objectives/criteria established within the response plan.

It is important to recognise that although CITG may have closed down, it is likely that some aspects of a critical incident response may require further engagement or treatment (e.g. continued media interest).

### Stage 7: After action review

Following a critical incident involving BRC staff, volunteers or associated parties, a formal debrief with all those affected or involved in the management of
the incident will take place.

This debrief will be part of a wider After Action Review that aims to assess the organisation’s overall response to the incident; evaluate the various decisions and actions taken, and to review effectiveness of the CITG Management Team Plan and its associated tools and resources.

A detailed After Action Review report will outline how the incident transpired, key decisions and actions made, and lessons learned/recommendations are shared with members of the CITG and ELT only, unless further dissemination is explicitly approved by the CITG Chair.

## Business continuity

Business continuity for emergency response is managed throughout the eight Crisis Response areas with input from the national team.

Each area holds their own business continuity management plan which is owned by the HLCR Area Director and tested locally. A national Crisis Response plan arches the eight areas to monitor and assist with the management or organisational incidents and impacts, such as telecommunications failure, wide scale national emergencies, internal IT failures, etc. The national plan is owned by the Head of Crisis Response and is instigated and tested by the CR team.
