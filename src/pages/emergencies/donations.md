## Disaster fund

The British Red Cross Disaster Fund has been established to give the British Red Cross the flexibility to prepare for and respond rapidly to the most pressing emergency needs, whether in the UK or overseas. As part of the UK-based response to a major incident, an application may be made to the Disaster Fund for the following activities:

- a contribution to resource and equip Areas and UKO for exceptional costs of a sustained emergency response, (beyond those which might reasonably be covered within core costs)
- a contribution to multi-agency contingency plan for large-scale arrivals of people in the UK
- contingency funding for additional psychological support for British Red Cross personnel involved in major incidents in the UK or overseas
- to provide aid to those displaced, or at risk of being displaced, because of a disaster
- a contribution to initiate an emergency appeal on behalf of national, devolved or local government

Applications for Disaster Fund payments should be made to the Head of Crisis Response. A copy of the application form is available on RedRoom. <!--TODO link-->

## Tesco agreement

### Background

The British Red Cross and Tesco have a partnership to provide holistic support to British Red Cross emergency response activities at a local, national and international level. The partnership will facilitate an effective and timely response to support individuals affected by emergencies in the UK and across the world. The information below provides information on the arrangements for securing support for UK-based incidents.

### Tesco support to UK-based incidents

Tesco has agreed to support the British Red Cross response to a UK-based incident with the provision of goods such as food, water, and hygiene items. It should only be used to supply items for spontaneous emergencies and not pre-planned operations unless there has been specific approval.

This partnership agreement covers support for an incident defined in the ‘major incident notification’; it must not be used to request goods for British Red Cross daily service provision. Nothing in this agreement prevents Areas from maintaining existing supply arrangements with other providers. When assessing its response, Tesco will consider:

- the scale and level of need of the incident, as reported by the British Red Cross
- current stock levels and distribution requirements
- the level of demand set by their customers and staff

### Application procedure

Area teams can access goods to the amount of £750 from a tesco store. When an area identifies a need to access the agreement, they should contact the CR team.

Please provide the following details where possible:

- Details of the incident
- What items are required and approximate amounts
- The store you would like to collect from (preferably an ‘extra’ store, especially if requesting large amounts of items or when clothing is required)
- Timeframes
- The name of the volunteer attending the store

The CR team will liaise with Tescos and advise when the store is ready for the volunteer.

Please note, Tesco will consider their stock levels when deciding whether they can accept the request.

### Unused goods

Unused non-perishable Tesco donated goods should be stored for use in future responses; unused perishable goods may be utilised for daily service provision. There is no requirement to return unused goods to Tesco.

### Post-incident reports

The Tesco reporting template (below) should include the following information:

- Type of goods requested
- Cost of goods
- Type of response
- Number of people supported in the response.

### Liaison with local authorities

British Red Cross will co-ordinate and deliver all requests for Tesco goods requested as part of the response to a UK-based incident. Tesco Store Managers have been instructed to refer any such enquiries from local authority personnel to the local Red Cross.

UKO will advise relevant UK/national level organisations of this arrangement. Area managers should notify their local authority partners of the arrangement and provide them with information of any goods donated as part of a specific response.

## Kingfisher agreement

Kingfisher and the Red Cross are working in partnership to ensure that people and their homes are more resilient against disaster. Kingfisher (who own B&Q) have designated cages across the UK to support our teams respond to emergencies.

Currently, there are 5 cages available in 2 different locations; Swindon and Worksop and they can be delivered to **any location** in the UK within **24 hours** of request.

To access this agreement, contact the CR Team.

## Disaster appeal scheme

The British Red Cross launches emergency appeals to support the Movement response to disasters across the world. The decision to launch an appeal is based on the scale and urgency of the disaster, our ability to provide effective and timely assistance and public awareness of and sympathy for the humanitarian situation.

Should there be a need for a national or international appeal anywhere in the UK, local authorities can contact their British Red Cross Area team to request the launch of an appeal. A discussion would then commence between the Local Authority, fundraising and the CR team to agree to terms of distribution of the fund.

The decision to launch an appeal is made by the Executive Directors of International/UK Operations, Communications and the Chief Supporter Officer. [The procedure for whether or not to launch an appeal and the process to follow can be found on RedRoom](https://britishredcross.interactgo.com/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=10275&SearchId=872845).

To set up a disaster appeal in your area or if you receive a request from a local authority to do so, contact the CR Team.

## Corporate partnerships and non-financial support

This procedure outlines how the BRC corporate partnerships team can support through the provision of non-financial support such as products and services.

We have several existing relationships with companies, and these partners may provide funds or goods to support the work of the BRC. Partners, especially during emergencies, may proactively offer or can be called upon to support an incident.

During an emergency area ER teams should consider what the needs are of those in crisis and what could be provided by our corporate partners.

Any requests for support are to be channelled via the National CR team. Please note that prior to each request being made, teams should ensure they have considered what collection, transport and storage options are available.

The BRC has an Emergency Protocol in place with Tesco (see ‘Tesco agreement’ earlier in this guidance), but also many other relationships with companies who may be able to offer support. Some of our existing relationships include:

- Amazon
- H&M
- John Lewis Partnership
- Kingfisher (B&Q and Screwfix)
- Land Rover
- TK Maxx
