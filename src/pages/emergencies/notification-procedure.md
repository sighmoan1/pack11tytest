This summary provides detail on how and when to notify the national crisis response (CR Team) team of an incident.

When an Area responds to an incident that meets any of the criteria below, UK CR Team should be notified by calling the 24/7 on-call number: [0115 965 8558](tel:01159658558) This notification procedure applies across all services and should be followed where normal service delivery escalates above and beyond our business as usual work. The following list provides a non-exhaustive range of notification criteria:

- When an incident is declared a major incident by category I (or equivalent) partner
- When co-responding with external partners to a significant event (not a declared major incident) that is resource intensive
- When a “business as usual” response e.g. two volunteers in an emergency response vehicle attending a call out from the Fire and Rescue service escalates beyond the capacity of that response i.e. additional resources are required
- A surge in health/social care issues (e.g. Pandemic Influenza or increased hospital admissions) warrants the provision of additional British Red Cross resources
- When a surge in arrivals of vulnerable migrants to the UK (e.g. asylum seekers or resettled refugees) requires additional support and resources from the British Red Cross.
- An overseas incident that increases the volume of International Family Tracing requests
- When a response is likely to generate significant media interest
- When a response is likely to significantly impact British Red Cross profile or business
continuity arrangements
- When a response requires the deployment of Community Reserve Volunteers
- When any UK Ops service is facing any incident that overwhelms its capacity to respond without additional organisational resource/response

## UK Crisis Response Team

Examples of how the UK CR Team can support mutual aid working:

- Provide support and advice related to the specific response e.g. provision of trained strategic or tactical managers
- Act as a conduit (single point of contact) for others within the organisational structure who require updates on the response to the emergency
- Support with the CRCC the coordination of mutual aid from other Areas
- Negotiation with organisations, internal and external partners and donors on a national basis (e.g. suppliers, major supermarkets, other voluntary agencies)
- Activate mutual aid from other Services, International LOGS team, PST, Federation
- Support and advice on the use of deployment of Community Reserve Volunteers

## Examples of how the UK CR Team can support the British Red Cross major response plan

- Provision of support to the strategic and tactical managers, avoiding involvement in both operational level decision-making and contact with local external response partners
- Forming a tactical coordination group when an incident covers multiple areas or there is a crossservice response. This group will liaise with the Area/ Service tactical managers following SCG meetings
- Provision of technical advice to the British Red Cross Strategic Co-ordination Group (SCG), probably by the Head of CR
- Co-ordination of large-scale/cross area/national response
- Deployment of a UK CR staff member as the Tactical Adviser to the Strategic Manager
- Secretariat to the SCG
- Provide loggist support to the SCG
