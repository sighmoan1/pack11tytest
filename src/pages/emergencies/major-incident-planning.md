## Major Incident Plan

This section provides information on the British Red Cross major incident plan.

The British Red Cross major incident plan provides a framework for the organisation to respond to a major incident. The plan is designed to enable the British Red Cross’s senior management to respond to the consequences of the emergency, irrespective of its cause and to build on local emergency planning and response arrangements.

The activation of the major incident plan and the Tactical/Strategic Co-ordinating Group supplement the strategic, tactical and operational management structure, they do not replace it. Upon the declaration of a major incident, an operations room may be allocated, which may be virtual or physical.

The British Red Cross major incident plan provides the ‘critical switch’ that facilitates the change of pace and priorities required to move the British Red Cross from its normal operating procedures to a faster-time, surge incident response mode. This could include:

- more specific response-focus for support and activation of the full command and control structure
- re-prioritisation of current work plans
- re-prioritisation of IT activities, e.g. postponement of routine maintenance and provision of 24/7 support
- re-allocation of personnel, where appropriate, to support the response.

For the purposes of the British Red Cross major response plan, an exceptional or major emergency is defined as one that is likely to meet all the following three criteria:

- have an impact on several directorates and/or Areas, and
- have wide-ranging implications for the British Red Cross, and
- extend for more than three days.

It may also be appropriate to regard an incident as an exceptional or major emergency if:

- COBR, or equivalents within the Devolved Administrations, has been activated as part of the response to the incident
- existing or emerging British Red Cross issues (UK or international) indicate it would be appropriate to regard the incident as an exceptional or major emergency.

The decision to implement the British Red Cross major incident plan will be made by the appropriate Divisional Director, in liaison with the CEO, or their nominee, i.e.:

- UK Director for Independent Living and Crisis Response, or their nominee, for a large-scale UK based major incident
- Director of programmes and partnerships (international), or their nominee, for a large-scale international disaster response
- The relevant Director, or their nominee, for a largescale internal British Red Cross incident.

Members of the British Red Cross Executive Leadership Team (ELT) should adopt the following guidance when involved in the response to an exceptional or major emergency:

- where the nature or scale of the incident indicates that it may be desirable for an ELT level manager to undertake the Strategic Manager role, the appointed member of ELT should have achieved competence in this role, see command and control structure section
- relevant members of ELT should become members of the British Red Cross Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG)
- when visiting or supporting a response Area as part of a profile raising or British Red Cross personnel support activity, members of ELT should recognise
that a separate operational response structure will have been developed and that they should avoid action that could create command confusion.

## Threat assessment

The British Red Cross major incident threat assessment should deal with the analysis of potential or actual harm to people; the probability of it occurring; and the consequences or impact should it occur. The assessment will enable the British Red Cross to analyse relevant potential or actual injury or damage, including: physical harm; psychological harm; economic harm; and harm to the community. It may also include ‘organisational harm’, i.e. the impact on the operations and reputation of the British Red Cross.

Whilst the strategic manager will need to be aware of any threat assessment that has been undertaken by relevant Category 1 and 2 Responders, they will need to undertake a British Red Cross specific threat assessment that:

- is based on information known at the time
- takes account of the nature of any threat anticipated and its proximity
- identifies to whom and under what circumstances the threat may occur
- describes any consequences or impacts, focusing on humanitarian need
- takes account of the impact of change in the developing situation.

## Developing the Strategic Direction

The aims and direction of the organisation have been laid out in the 2030 Strategy. These aims break down into strategic objectives as shown below.

| Strategic Theme | Strategic Goal| Strategic Objectives|
|---|---|---|
|Disaster|People are safe and able to survive and recover whenever disaster strikes| - Prepare people and communities by taking early action<br>- Coordinate and scale a people centred response<br>- Protect those experiencing conflict under international humanitarian law<br>- Speak up about the humanitarian impact of disasters as a result of climate change|
| Health  | People in the UK receive the care and support they need without falling through gaps in the healthcare system | - Empowering people to improve connections and wellbeing – reducing vulnerability health crisis<br>- Provide access the right care at the right time<br>- Ensure that there is support in place for people to live safely at home.|
| Displacement| People experiencing displacement feel safe, live with dignity and have choice and opportunity on their journey| - Protect and keep people safe meet their needs during journeys<br>- Eradicate extreme poverty (destitution) for people experiencing displacement in the UK<br>- Help people rebuild lives and restore links with loved ones.|

The strategic direction of a response should be set as early as practicable in collaboration with teams working on the ground and the wider organisation and should include clear aims.

The aims/objectives of any response should be in line with the BRC’s strategy. Aims should be specific enough to enable and empower decision making on the ground but broad enough to allow for the inevitable dynamic nature of emergency responses and the differences of need across communities and individuals.

**Strategic Direction: When, who and how?**
Once the first information is received and a threat assessment has been undertaken, the Strategic Manager must develop an initial strategy, and appropriate tactical options. In this context, a strategy can be defined as ‘a plan of action designed to achieve a series of objectives or a particular goal’. The British Red Cross strategy, its rationale and any amendments to it should be recorded in the incident log.

Where a formal command structure is in place, the British Red Cross Strategic Manager should consult with the British Red Cross Tactical Manager in the development of the British Red Cross strategy. If the British Red Cross major response plan has been invoked, the British Red Cross Strategic Co-ordinating Group will also be involved in the development of the strategy.

The main factors to be considered when developing a British Red Cross emergency response strategy include:

- establishing an agreed set of objectives relevant to the knowledge of the situation, arising from the threat assessment
- be dynamic and capable of revision in the light of amended threat assessments
- a list of clear and unambiguous objectives
- enable the Tactical Manager to make justifiable decisions and implement tactical options
- recognising that each incident is unique and must have its own strategy, although previous, similar incidents may provide a list of objectives that can be referred to when developing the strategy
- avoiding the use of generic, non-specific objectives such as ‘providing humanitarian assistance’ unless it can be shown how humanitarian assistance can be provided specifically in relation to that operation
- using plain language as the use of terms that are not understood may lead to misinterpretation and cause confusion.

Whilst the detail of the British Red Cross strategic intention will need to vary with the circumstances of each incident, it is probable that it will include the following three elements:

1. Responding to the human aspects of the incident
2. Addressing the health and safety elements of the
response
3. Maximising the opportunity for positive external and
internal communication of the British Red Cross
response, including generating media coverage

### Development of the Major Incident Communication Strategy

- recognition that British Red Cross involvement in the response to exceptional or major emergencies may attract national and on occasion, international media interest
- SCG should develop suitable internal and external communication strategies to enable relevant British Red Cross personnel and external partners to be made aware of the agreed British Red Cross strategy
- determine the extent to which it is appropriate to disseminate the aim and objectives (there may be occasions when some elements could be viewed as business sensitive)
- decide whether the Strategic Manager will talk directly with the media or whether it is more appropriate for another individual to present the information, allowing the Strategic Manager to focus on the response
- identify the internal and external communication mechanisms to be used in their dissemination
- establish a two-way flow of information between those involved in managing the response and other British Red Cross personnel
- methods of internal communication should be reviewed, regularly and feedback invited from audiences, where practical and appropriate.

## Strategy and the Strategic Coordination Group

The SCG has a key role to play in supporting the Strategic and Tactical Managers and facilitating a British Red Cross-wide, integrated approach to the incident. It should not undertake an operational role nor deal with operational-level issues. The structure, membership, roles and responsibilities of the SCG must be consistent with and complementary to those of the Strategic and Tactical Managers. The SCG is intended to supplement the strategic, tactical and operational management structure, not to replace it. The SCG should have access to the resources required to undertake its role but should not allow itself to become distracted by dealing with information or issues that are not key to its activities. It is better to activate the SCG on a precautionary basis and then stand it down than to be forced to activate it belatedly, under the pressure of events. Please see Command and Control structure for further guidance.

The British Red Cross major response plan and the SCG should be implemented or exercised at least once every two years.

## Possible action points for the Strategic Co-ordinating Group

### Operational issues

- Does the SCG need to be expanded to include additional members?
- Does the SCG need to issue instructions/guidance to guarantee that staffing of the response is a priority activity, for the duration of the operation?
- Does the British Red Cross need to approach other voluntary sector organisations that may not be part of the response, to secure their support and resources?
- Does the SCG need to appoint personnel to co-ordinate mutual aid?
- Does the British Red Cross need to employ/second additional project officers to assist in the management of specific elements of the response, e.g. support line or survivor network?
- What review mechanism and report format should be followed?

### Communication issues

- Who should be the lead external communication contact person?
- How will we inform our personnel of the British Red Cross involvement in the operation?
- What information can be communicated to the media?
- To what extent, if any, is our scope for external communication limited by involvement with Government Departments or other organisations?
- Are additional communication resources required?

### Human resource issues

- Does P&L need to appoint a lead person to deal with the HR issues?
- Are there implications for the Volunteer Operations and People & Learning staff?
- What system should be created to provide early notification to HR of activities that may have HR implications?
- Where personnel work additional hours, will they be compensated and if so, how?
- Is there a need to create new role descriptions?
- Does the British Red Cross need to employ additional personnel to meet the requirements of the response? If yes, who will deal with funding, contracts etc.?
- What personnel support facilities will be made available?
- Will the British Red Cross need to recruit, urgently, additional volunteers If yes, what process should be adopted?

### Finance and funding issues

- Should the British Red Cross set up an appeal fund?
- Does the British Red Cross need to make additional funding available to support the operation?
- Should a finance co-ordinator be appointed to support the operational personnel and oversee the financial issues connected with the operation?
- Does a response specific, non-standard audit trail need to be introduced?

### Facilities issues

- Does the British Red Cross need to activate the facilities business continuity plan?
- Does additional accommodation/equipment need to be made available?

## Making decisions on incoming requests for assistance

To consider when deciding whether we can undertake an activity related to the response:

1. Does the request address (any of) the strategic aims of the response?
2. Are there no other VCS partners who are better placed to deliver/co-deliver?
3. Does the activity address a short-term/emergency need?
4. Do we have capacity the carry out the request?
5. Are the activities required to fulfil the request part of our usual suite of activities (i.e. any new skills or training required to carry out the request)?
6. What are the health and safety considerations for undertaking this request?

Where the answer is no to any of the above questions or it requires further discussion, the request should be escalated to the most appropriate level depending on the command and control structure of the response.

A TCG may discuss the following in relation to an escalated request:

- Are there any similar activities operating elsewhere in the organisation?
- Do we think we should deliver? (strategy, aims, capacity, other activity in area, reach, vulnerability)
- Who has an ‘interest’ in the new activity (H&S, legal, financial, operational)?

An SCG may need to consider a request in the following circumstances:

- Where the request/issue poses major organisational risks
- Where the UKCG are unable to reach a decision
- Where the issue would involve the development of a new product
