## Glossary

Here we explain some of the terms used in this guide and in the wider emergency response service.

| Term| Definition|
|---|---|
| CRV (Community Reserve Volunteer) Team leader | Responsible for oversight of a team of CRVs in an emergency |
| Command | The authority for an agency to direct the actions of its own resources (both personnel and equipment). |
| Control | The authority to direct strategic and tactical operations to complete an assigned function, including the ability to direct the activities of other agencies engaged in the completion of that function. |
| Emergency Response Volunteer | Service specific volunteers who have undertaken core ER training (and other training defined on the learning pathway), this role provides practical and emotional support to people affected by emergencies and can also provide additional capacity to other service lines in times of crisis. |
| Duty Manager | Designated on call contact for Area teams. |
| Group Leader | A volunteer who works with the local Emergency Response Officer to coordinate local emergency response volunteer groups. |
| Lead Volunteer | A volunteer member of an emergency response volunteer group who takes a lead role/ lead responsibility within the group. |
| Major Incident | Declared by a Category 1, an event or situation with a range of serious consequences which requires special arrangements to be implemented by one or more emergency responder agency. |
| Mutual aid | The provision of additional capability and support to an emergency, when normal responding capacity is overwhelmed. |
| Operational Manager | May be appointed in addition to OTL(s) (particularly where multiple operations are running concurrently). Manages the wider picture of a response (s)/ oversight of OTL (s) and usually represents areas at tactical level meetings. |
| Operational Team Leader | This role is allocated during an incident to a volunteer or staff member who leads a team on the ground, they are responsible for operational delivery of the tactical plan in an emergency. |
| Planned operation | Sometimes referred to as a ‘pre-planned’ operation, is an operation for which the British Red Cross has had advanced warning of occurring; this would include events such as the Great North Run, anti-human trafficking responses or refugee resettlement activities, etc. |
| Resources | Refers to staff, volunteers, expertise or equipment. |
| Responding area(s) | Area(s) in which the emergency occurs and which therefore takes the ‘lead’ in providing a response to those affected. |
| Spontaneous operation | An operation in which the British Red Cross has not had prior warning or notification and so will not have had the opportunity to develop incident specific strategies, tactics and contingency plans. A spontaneous incident will require an initial response even though the information about the incident may be incomplete. This initial response should, where possible, include a provision for increasing the level of information to help to shape the subsequent response. |
| Standby | Where resources are put aside for a response, whether volunteers or equipment. |
| Supporting area(s) | Areas providing mutual aid to the lead area in response to the emergency. |
