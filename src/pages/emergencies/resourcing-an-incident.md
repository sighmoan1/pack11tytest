## Lone responding procedure

This procedure outlines how and when it is appropriate to deploy a single volunteer or staff member to an incident with or without a BRC vehicle. The process for deploying a lone responder is split into three parts:

1. [Signing off a volunteer as suitable for lone responding](#1-signing-off-a-volunteer-as-suitable-for-lone-responding)
2. [Assessing an incident as suitable for lone responding](#2-assessing-an-incident-as-suitable-for-lone-responding)
3. [Ensuring the lone responder is suitably monitored whilst deploying.](#3-ensuring-the-lone-responder-is-suitably-monitored-whilst-deploying)

### 1. Signing off a volunteer as suitable for lone responding

Volunteers must be individually signed off by their line manager ahead of a deployment. Line managers are not obligated to sign people off for lone responding, this decision will be made based on a robust assessment of needs and risk in your area. When considering a volunteer for lone responding, line managers should assess the following factors:

- The wishes of the volunteer: are they confident, comfortable and keen to be a lone responder? Is there any further training they could undertake?
- Their previous experience: they should have responded to incidents before (ideally at least 2 but this will depend on the needs and activity in your area)
- Feedback from others: do you have any information from previous Operational Team Leaders, team members or service user feedback to indicate their suitability for lone responding

Once the above assessment has been made,
line manager must:

- Bring the lone working policy, the lone working procedure and driving procedure to the attention of the volunteer
- Complete lone working individual risk assessment form with the volunteer
- Advise volunteer to inform their insurance company that they are using their personal cars for a volunteering role. This is usually not at additional cost.
- Check their next-of-kin contact details are correct and update on Assemble if required

### 2. Assessing an incident as suitable for lone responding

When a request is received for a BRC deployment to an incident, the CRCC/Duty manager may consider lone deployment to that incident based on the availability of volunteers and the speed and effectiveness of our response.

Before a decision is made to lone deploy the following factors must be considered:

- The time of day/night
- The nature of the incident
- The weather conditions in the area (high winds,
snow and ice etc)
- A discussion has taken place with requesting
agency on circumstances on call out and
suitability for lone responding including:
  - Location of deployment
  - Known behaviour of service users at location
  - Risks identified
- Organisational reputation; is 1 volunteer suitable
resource for the type and nature of the incident?

### 3. Ensuring the lone responder is suitably monitored whilst deploying

Checklist for use by CRCC/DM
<!-- TODO make into checklist-->

#### Before deployment

[ ] The available volunteer is signed off as a lone responder
[ ] The volunteer has been appraised of the incident details and is comfortable with lone responding
[ ] The volunteer has a mobile phone that is charged and has the means to contact the CRCC/DM
[_________] Type and registration number of the vehicle the volunteer is using
[ ] The volunteer will inform CRCC/DM if any plans change
[ ] The volunteer has made the CRCC/DM aware of any relevant medical issues
[ ] The volunteer has agreed to check in with the CRCC/DM when they arrive on scene, when they stand
down and at appropriate intervals (minimum every hour)
[ ] The volunteer has the appropriate stock/forms/information for the incident (see below)

#### During/after deployment

[ ] CRCC/DM is monitoring the length of time the volunteer is deployed
[ ] The volunteer is checking in at least every hour
[ ] The volunteer will check in when they reach their home or final destination after responding
[ ] If the volunteer fails to check in, the CRCC will follow the procedure for missing volunteer or staff member

## Procedure for missing volunteer or staff member

This procedure is for use when a volunteer or staff member is responding to an emergency response incident and has not checked in with the CRCC/DM as agreed.

The CRCC/DM will agree a check in frequency with volunteers upon deployment. In the case of a lone responder, this should be at least once an hour. If a volunteer fails to check in, the CRCC/DM will follow the following steps:

1. The CRCC/DM to call the volunteer every 10 minutes for three further attempts
2. At 30 minutes after the last scheduled and missed check:
  a. Where possible and appropriate. The CRCC/DM will contact the requesting agency to establish if they are able to make contact with the volunteer on scene or provide any further information
  b. If the CRCC is managing this incident, contact the DM
3. At 40 minutes after the last scheduled and missed check in, the CRCC/DM will contact the service user to whom the volunteer has deployed if these details are available
4. At 50 minutes after the last scheduled and missed check in, the CRCC/DM will contact the volunteer’s next of kin to establish any further information.
5. Throughout this process, the CRCC/DM will continue to attempt contact with the volunteer every 10 minutes
6. At one hour after the last scheduled and missed check in, the CRCC/DM will:
  a. contact the police (using 999), providing
all relevant details including the volunteer’s
contact details and vehicle registration
  b. contact the CR team and initiate Critical
Incident Procedure.

Where appropriate, you might ask the Operational Team Leader to attempt a welfare check on the volunteer before contacting police, for example, where a volunteer has failed to check in once home.

## Mutual aid

The provision of additional capability and support to an emergency, when normal responding capacity is overwhelmed. Mutual Aid refers to any resource, expertise or equipment available anywhere in the organisation e.g. wheelchairs, volunteers from other services, media support.

1. Incident occurs
2. Responding Area /CRCC / CRCC notifies CR Team of activity as per the notifiable incident procedure
3. Responding Area /CRCC is unable to resource the response with existing available resources
4. Responding Area details additional resource requirements and calls CR Team to request mutual aid. If the response is complex or protracted, the ‘Mutual Aid Request Form’ should be used to document mutual aid requirements. The CR Team will advise when this is required. You can [Find a request form and resource tracker on RedRoom](https://britishredcross.interactgo.com/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=10275&SearchId=872845).
5. CR Team contacts other Area ER Duty Managers or other services with mutual aid requirements
6. Both the Requesting and Supporting Areas/Service should designate a focal point for the coordination of mutual aid within their Area/Service
7. Supporting Area/Service confirms availability of resources with CR Team
8. CR Team confirms mutual aid availability with Requesting Area/CRCC
9. Resources are deployed
10. Incident ends or mutual aid is no longer required: Supporting Areas or Services are stood down and returned home
11. Incident ends: Responding Area and key stakeholders in the response manage relevant post-incident activities

## Community reserve volunteers

CRVs can be called upon to support our existing personnel by carrying out tasks at an incident that do not require any training or safeguarding. This means our regular volunteers can focus on supporting people in crisis and undertaking more specialist tasks that they are trained and equipped to do.

Anyone can sign up to be a CRV if they want to help in their community during times of crisis. Once deployed to an incident, a dedicated Team Leader is responsible for the operational management of the CRV for the duration of the deployment.

Before a request for CRVs is made, clear tasks should be identified for CRVs and a dedicated team leader should be available to supervise and manage the CRVs at the incident for the duration of their deployment.

The requesting team are responsible for undertaking dynamic risk assessments for any tasks that CRVs will be performing. The following deployment procedure should be followed when requesting CRVs:

1. Incident occurs
2. A suitable task for CRVs is identified. If the Area Duty Manager is unsure if the task identified is suitable for CRVs, contact CRT on call to discuss.
3. Areas make use of CRV deployment tool and notify CRCC of CRV deployment
4. Before deployment, Area DM ensures:
    - A dedicated team leader is available
    - Suitable task(s) have been identified
    - A route to deployment has been agreed
5. CRV Team Leader briefs the CRVs on arrival and takes over operational management of CRVs at the incident
6. CRV Team Leader debriefs the CRVs at the end of the deployment and feeds information back to Area Duty Manager
7. Area Duty Manager feeds back issues raised in the debrief, lessons learned and general update to the CRV Project Manager in CRT.

Contact CRT for further information <CRT@redcross.org.uk>

## Restoring family links

The Restoring Family Links service helps people look for family members, restore contact, reunite families and seeks to clarify the fate of those who remain missing.

Services include:

- International Family Tracing - working with the ICRC and other national societies around the world to locate people and put them back into contact with their relatives
- Family reunion and resettlement - reuniting families who have been separated and have been allowed by the Home Office to join their families in the UK
- Travel assistance for refugees whose families live overseas and have been granted a visa to come to the UK
- Refugee family reunion visa application support.

Further information on managing surge can be sought through the IFT out of hours number: [07710 008711](tel:07710008711).

## Psychosocial and mental health support

The Psychosocial and Mental Health (PMH) team are here to support our front-line responders and can deliver this support to ER teams through our area based practitioners. The support can involve:

- monthly sessions for frontline responders through group and individual peer support (semi-structured sessions where responders can consider more challenging aspects of their work, build self and team efficacy, and explore their own reactions to difficult or distressing situations)

- debriefings and urgent 1:1 responses following major events
- delivering workshops that are tailored to the needs of your teams (e.g., Understanding Trauma, Suicide Awareness, Dealing with Intense Events, Understanding Mental Health, Anger and Aggression, Resilience Building, etc.).
- building sustainability through a peer support model Information and resources showing where the team operate, who is the lead Practitioner for each area and where workshops, groups and one to one opportunities are being delivered is available on RedRoom or by contacting <CALMER@redcross.org.uk>

Should you, a staff member or volunteer require urgent support during or after an incident (or at any other time), you can access the Employee Assistance Package or Staff and volunteer support service by calling: [0800 030 5182](tel:08000305182)

In exceptional circumstances, psychosocial specialists may be able to support ER staff and volunteers on site at an incident, any request of this nature should be made through the PMH Team or through the Head of Crisis Response.

## International directorate

The British Red Cross International Directorate have a range of teams and technical functions that normally support in overseas incidents but may be able to provide specific support to a UK-based incident. The Emergencies Surge and Technical Advisory (ESTA) can provide mutual aid for UK emergencies.

The type of support available through ESTA and from the International Directorate falls into the following categories:

- Technical / programmatic advice and support – from assessment, response option analysis, response programming, monitoring and evaluation, community engagement and accountability (CEA), compliance (with core humanitarian standards for example), as well as technical advisory support on, for instance, cash-based programming, supply chain and logistics (i.e. distributions)
- Material support, encompassing: Emergency response equipment – such as office / storage tents, personal field kits, generators, area lighting, vehicles (from light 4x4 to 7.5mt 4x4 trucks), comms (sat ‘phones, radios etc.) and IT
- Procurement support – sourcing and procurement of any item the response requires, working in conjunction with SSC procurement team
- HR / delegate support: mobilising staff / delegates with competencies including assessment, programme design, management and implementation, cash-based responses, logistics & supply chain, monitoring and evaluation

The availability of resources from will depend upon their current deployment status. Lead-time for sourcing and delivery of supplies should be allowed for, depending upon the time of day and geographical location of the incident (this is generally within 24 hrs for initial attendance and 3 days for further supplies).

Any requests for the deployment of International teams should be made to the UK CR Team.

## Mobility aids service
<!-- TODO image-->

The British Red Cross MAS team offers a loan of wheelchairs and other mobility items to any individual on a short term basis.

MAS operates under a hub and spoke system where individuals can book a wheelchair in advance. There are eight hubs across the UK; Warmely,Harlow, Manvers, Carlisle, Crawley, Livingstone, Telford and Omagh.

### MAS Operating Procedures

MAS Hubs will retain a stock of 36 clean, ready to use wheelchairs for immediate use in each of their 8 Hubs.

Emergency use wheelchairs will be clearly marked by MAS who will make them accessible 24/7 and will re-service and re-clean them upon return.

Wherever possible, Area ER teams should provide advance notice if need is anticipated such as in advance of evacuations due to anticipated coastal flooding, etc. MAS Hub Managers will facilitate delivery or access during office hours and will ensure teams will have access to Hubs out of hours.

The process for accessing wheelchairs either in or out of hours is outlined below:

| Office hours (immediate or advance notice) |
|---|
| ER teams identify need for wheelchairs|
|Area contacts MAS Hub on [0300 456 1914](tel:03004561914) Further details are on [RedRoom](https://britishredcross.interactgo.com/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=4428&SearchId=846198) <!--TODO this link goes nowhere-->|
|Should an MAS Hub located in a neighbouring CR Area be needed, Area to contact UK CR Team.|
| Hub manager arranges delivery where possible or access for pick up|
|Area to email or phone MAS hub manager to advise which stock is used and anticipated return/pickup|

| Out of hours |
|---|
|ER teams identify need for wheelchairs|
|Area accesses MAS Hub site as documented in out of hours procedures. Contact the CR Team for access details|
|Should an MAS Hub located in a neighbouring CR Area be needed, Area to contact UK CR Team.|
|Area to email or phone MAS hub manager to advise which stock is used and anticipated return/pickup|
