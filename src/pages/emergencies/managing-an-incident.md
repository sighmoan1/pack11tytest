## Incident and Decision Logging in an emergency

### Introduction and purpose

This procedure is primarily aimed at our emergency response activity and should be followed at all levels of the organisations. Following the logging procedure ensures the organisation has a comprehensive record of events, decisions, reasoning behind key decisions and actions taken. The purpose of logging is to keep a real time record of the incident which may be used for any or all of the following circumstances:

- Handover and change of post holder
- To facilitate debriefing
- For an official inquiry/investigation
- To identify lessons, learning and best practice to be
made more widely available for those who might be
involved in future emergencies.

### Who and when to use this guidance?

Records or a log should be kept by anyone involved in managing or operating in an incident. This guidance is specifically aimed at:

- Anyone acting in a Duty Manager capacity
- Designated response managers (strategic, tactical,
operational)
- Team leaders
- The CRCC
- Those working in an operations room
- Those working as a decision loggist (and/or actions
manager) at BRC tactical and/or strategic meetings

### What and how to log effectively

This guidance is intended to provide a framework for logging and record keeping in incidents and while a suggested template is provided, it is recognised that many teams within the organisation will have their own way of logging incidents already such as Incident Report Forms, the CRCC log and the RAID log. Regardless of your team or position and role within the organisation, please use the following guidance when keeping logs/records in incidents. Ensure your entries are:

- Clear, Intelligible and Accurate
- Contemporaneous: Enter information at the first reasonable opportunity
- Professional and Credible
- Relevant: You are not required to log every small detail
- When recording decisions and actions, ensure your log includes:
- When (time and date), where and who was present
- The information discussed and available at the time
- The options that are/were available
- Record the actual language used to avoid the potential for misunderstanding
- Why you made the decision you did and the rationale behind it
- Who, if appropriate, you handed information on to and why
- Whether there were any team members that disagreed with that decision

### Logging template

[This logging template](https://brcsbrms.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Crisisresponsetaskandfinishgroups/EQvu0SSGxrRMq2PHXisVp8MBoOM2P5pS7v6CmAub6WlkRg?e=rMfUYL) is recommended for operational and duty managers to keep consistency across the organisation. The document should be updated live and held in a relevant, accessible and secure location for your teams to reference. After the incident, the log should be saved in an appropriate place and kept as per retention guidelines.

Further guidance and tips:

- Avoid non-verbal or subjective judgements unless you feel that there is a good case to record this/these
- Ensure that the records are chronological
- Avoid jargon or shorthand
- Never write anything you would be unhappy to read out in court
- For handwritten notes:
  - Don’t erase mistakes. Rule through them with a single line and initial them. Don’t overwrite or write above them
  - Don’t leave blank space. Unused space at the end of lines should be ruled out with a single line. Unused space at the end of a page should be ruled through with a diagonal line, initialled and the date and time added.
  - if you use separate pieces of paper they all need to be numbered and kept and crossed reference with the log.

## British Red Cross emergency response stand down procedure

As early as possible within the response cycle, all parties involved should plan exit strategies appropriate to the response effort. Regular monitoring and review of those strategies as the response develops should ensure they are still valid and appropriate at any point in time.

The exit strategy should be a mutual discussion by British Red Cross (BRC) responding area(s) and responding partner agencies. The ultimate decision to stand down BRC resources will be made by BRC strategic lead, who will differ depending on the type and scale of the incident:

|Type of incident|Stand down decision maker|
|---|---|
|Large-scale incident|Appointed Strategic Manager/Strategic Coordination Group (SCG)|
|Incident involving on-call duty manager| Duty Manager (DM)|
|Small-scale incident that has not involved the on-call duty manager and the crisis response control centre (CRCC) is managing the incident|CRCC|
|Small-scale incident that is managed by Area BRC Emergency Response (ER) team where the CRCC are not managing the incident|Incident coordinator from the Area ER team, who informs CRCC|

When standing down from an incident, the person responsible for standing down should consider the following elements:

- Stand down agreement between BRC strategic/ tactical and partner agency strategic/tactical
- Stand down agreement with BRC operational team on scene
- Standing down of supporting areas and services (including CRCC if applicable)
- Standing down staff/volunteers on stand-by
- Communicating stand down and exit strategies (internally and externally – who, how, when, where, why?)
- Handover (to whom, when, how, by whom?)
- Ensure operational resources understand they have been stood down and their role in the response has finished
- Ensure operational resources have transport to onward location
- Recommissioning of equipment and/or top-up of supplies used (refuel/recharge vehicle, restock vehicle/grab bag/kit/stocks)
- Ensure hot debrief has taken place
- Follow up activities (reporting, debriefing, documentation, updating logs, closing incident, creating incident on BRM and completing audit trail)
- Ensure welfare check procedure for operational resources has been followed (if a volunteer is uncontactable, follow Missing Persons Procedure)
- Signposting to longer term support

## Exit strategy

As early as possible within the response cycle, all parties involved should plan exit strategies appropriate to the response effort. Regular monitoring and review of those strategies as the response develops should ensure they are still valid and appropriate at any point in time.

The exit strategy should be a mutual decision by both the responding area(s), supporting area(s) and any national coordinating group such as the TCG/SCG and should consider, at a minimum, the following elements:

- Standing-down of supporting areas
- Communicating exit strategies (internally and externally – who, how, when, where, why)
- Handover (to whom, when, how, by whom?)
- Re-commissioning of equipment and/or top-up of supplies used
- Follow-up activities (reporting, de-briefing, documentation and audit trail).

## Multiple incidents

In the event of multiple incidents with multiple local/service line managers, the coordination/support to those incidents and areas will be provided by a designated team at the national level. The tasks performed by this team would be command support and would allow a strategic manager to request and direct the mutual aid of resources appropriately when there is pressure from every Area for them.

Areas providing mutual aid would need to provide:

- What capability and capacity has been deployed to the response
- What capability and capacity has been allocated for the response (or allocated elsewhere)
- What remaining capability and capacity is available as potential mutual aid (see national mutual aid database)
- If appropriate, this detail will be recorded during situational reporting.

## Media relations

Communicating with external and internal audiences is a vital part of any emergency response operation. Our Ready for Anything report reveals that during an emergency, people affected want timely, reliable information from a trusted source, and most turn to local radio and TV stations, their own friends and family and local authority websites for this information. When the Red Cross responds to any emergency, the media team will liaise with partners and the local area team and, if relevant, national media, to communicate what support the Red Cross is providing, including specifics of how and where to access this help, or other information such as first aid or safety advice. Increasingly social media will also be a key part of the communications approach.

As well as providing an important source of reassurance and information, emergency responses are an opportunity to tell the Red Cross story in a way that positions us effectively as a source of neutral and impartial humanitarian support to local communities affected by crises. It is important that volunteers and staff engage with the communications process and that Red Cross communications professionals support them adequately by equipping them with the tools, skills and resources to tell the story of the emergency effectively, without jeopardising any aspect of the response itself.

In invoking mutual aid all parts of the organisation will need to adopt a clear, coordinated approach to communications across all teams involved in the response. A communications strategy and tactical plan should be part of the response planning.

### To contact the media team for information, advice and support

In hours (9am-5pm Monday to Friday)

1. Call your regional media officer (see map)
2. Call UK media manager
3. Call national press line – [0207 877 7557](tel:02078777557)

Out of hours (Saturday, Sunday and after 5pm Monday-Friday)
Call out of hours media officer – [07710 391 703](tel:07710391703)

### The media relations role

The media relations role is designed to highlight the great things we do in the print, broadcast and online media. This can reassure the public in times of crisis, inform them of support available to them and raise awareness of the Red Cross and the services we run. In turn this will increase support, including funding and the support of new volunteers.

Always inform a member of the media team when approached by the media (see contacts box above).

### Top interview tips

The media will want any of the following: a quote, a statement, a press release or an interview.

1. Before doing the interview contact the media relations officer or a member of the communications team. We will help find out the angle of the piece, what questions they want to ask, and whether the interview is live or pre-recorded.
2. If your manager has agreed you can act as a spokesperson, prepare your three key messages and talk through the questions you might be asked.
3. The media are not there to catch you out, but remember that everything is “on the record”.
4. You are representing the Red Cross. Remember we are a neutral organisation. Stick to facts and key messages and avoid personal opinion.
5. If you are asked a question you do not know the answer to don’t worry! Simply say: “I’m sorry, I don’t have the information on that but what is important is…”
6. Relax and be yourself. Take a few deep breaths and try not to be nervous. Remember you know the subject better than the person who is interviewing you.

### Key messages

1. The British Red Cross responds to a UK emergency every four hours. We help people prepare for, cope with and recover from crises
2. The Red Cross works alongside local authorities, the police, ambulance and fire service, to help people cope after a fire, flood or other emergency, providing practical help, advice and comfort
3. Our volunteers are equipped with a speciallyadapted vehicle to offer safety and shelter – along with clothes, refreshments and other practical items people might need in an emergency
4. The Red Cross also helps people deal with other practicalities such as finding temporary accommodation or contacting their insurance company
5. Crucially, our volunteers are trained to provide emotional support, which can make a huge difference at a distressing time

### What you can say to media

**The five Ws and H (Who, What, Why, Where, When and How)**

1. Why the Red Cross was called out
2. How the Red Cross is helping (X fire and rescue service called the Red Cross to help residents evacuated because of a fire)
3. What the Red Cross is doing to help (providing emotional and practical support)
4. Who and where the Red Cross is helping (avoid using names, ages and addresses, unless the beneficiary has specifically said they are happy for this information to be supplied. You can say, for example, we are supporting a family of four)
5. When the Red Cross will stand down

### What not to say to media

**The Red Cross NEVER comments on the following:**

- Statistics on survivors, fatalities or numbers injured – this is a public information role that is provided by the Emergency Services ONLY. If asked about this, say: “It’s not appropriate for me to comment on that aspect of the situation as that’s a matter for the emergency services.”
- The performance of the emergency and statutory services, or other voluntary organisations – except that the Red Cross is there to support them.
- The cause of an incident. For example, if the incident is a rail crash, staff cannot speculate whether there was a derailment, or in the case of a factory fire, the cause of the fire.

**Always inform a senior representative when approached by the media:**

- During business hours call Rebecca (Mon-Thurs, [0117 3012624](tel:01173012624) or [07525 128297](tel:07525128297)) or Roshni (Fri, [0207 8777463](tel:02078777463) or [07872 047554](tel:07872047554)).
- Out of hours (after 5pm Monday-Friday or any time on Saturday and Sunday) contact the on-call media officer via the duty mobile phone [07710 391703](tel:07710391703).
- Routine out of hours ER callouts should be reported to Rebecca or Roshni as soon as possible the next working day. If it becomes a major incident contact the on-call media officer.

## Communications technology

A scenario requiring the provision of mutual aid relies upon all parties being able to communicate effectively. To affect this, communication mechanisms will need to be agreed and communicated. This can be facilitated by the CR Team if needed.

The co-ordination and administration required in a cross area mutual aid scenario will be large and may consist of some or all the following component parts:

- Deployment of a national communications vehicle
- Issue of radio systems to mutual aid participants
- Confirmation of local voice procedure protocols
- Provision of electrical charging facilities
- Mechanisms for communicating with other agencies
