  parent: UK emergencies guidance
---

The command and control structure shows how our emergency response and other teams from across the organisation operate in any incident. The structure is scalable depending on the nature and size of the response.

## Command and control in routine incidents

Please refer to page one of the command and control structure for guidance on Strategic, Tactical and Operational roles in an incident.
<!-- TODO figure out what this is referring to -->

In routine incidents, a formal command and control structure may not be initiated by the British Red Cross, however the principles of command and control will still be considered throughout the incident. For example, a team operating on the ground will be ‘operational’ the CRCC will be considering the ‘tactical’ elements and a duty manager may be referred to for any ‘strategic’ decisions. Similarly, it may be possible for a person to act in both the tactical and strategic role for a small-scale incident where appropriate.

## Command and control in larger incidents

Incidents that fall above routine incidents may require the implementation of a formal command and control structure. For details and refer to page 6 for guidance on when to invoke a formal C&C structure.
<!-- TODO figure out what this is referring to-->

In an exceptional or major emergency, the British Red Cross major response plan will be invoked. Further information on the British Red Cross major response plan can be found in this guidance.

## Hints and tips of the Command and Control structure

Strategic, tactical and operational may be referred to as Gold, Silver and Bronze.

Strategic, tactical and operational positions are role rather than grade specific. Managers of a grade senior to those nominated to undertake one of these three roles may not necessarily assume primacy solely based on their grade or geographic responsibility.

As an operation develops, it may be necessary to review the membership of the command structure to ensure that those performing the roles have achieved the appropriate level of competence.

To avoid command confusion, ‘arcing’ across the levels of command must be avoided, for example, the Strategic Manager should not normally give a direction to an Operations Manager if that direction has not been agreed with the Tactical Manager.

One British Red Cross Strategic Manager, only, will be deployed to an operation, at any one time.

## Roles and responsibilities

### Strategic Manager

The British Red Cross Strategic Manager is responsible for determining the strategy and the parameters to be followed by the British Red Cross Tactical and Operational Managers. They are responsible for ensuring that any tactics deployed meet the objectives of the strategy.

The British Red Cross Strategic Manager will:

- have overall responsibility and accountability for the British Red Cross operation
- chair of the British Red Cross Strategic Coordinating Group, if/when activated
- set, review, update and record the strategy or contribute to this through membership of the British Red Cross Strategic Co-ordinating Group
- maintain objectivity and not become involved in making tactical or operational level decisions or undertaking tactical or operational level tasks
- identify the level of support needed to deliver and maintain the British Red Cross response.

### Tactical Manager

The British Red Cross Tactical Manager commands and co-ordinates the overall tactical response in compliance with the strategy.

The British Red Cross Tactical Manager will:

- develop and co-ordinate the tactical plan to achieve the strategy set by the British Red Cross Strategic manager
- be suitably located to maintain effective tactical management of the operation
- record and manage risks, issues, actions and decisions at an operational level and where necessary escalate to the Strategic Manager or SCG, maintaining a clear audit trail. A template RAID log can be used for this purpose and can be accessed by contacting the CR team. <!--TODO make template available here-->
- provide the pivotal link in the management chain between the Operational and Strategic Managers
- ensure for adequate briefing and debriefing of British Red Cross personnel has taken place using UK CR briefing procedures.
- set up and chair a Tactical Coordinating Group if/when required

### Operational Management

Depending on the scale and type of incident, operational management may fall under the remit of the Operational Team Leader (OTL), who will be on scene managing the team responding to the incident, or if deemed appropriate, an Operational Manager may be appointed in addition to the OTL to coordinate the local response (particularly where there are multiple operations running concurrently).

The following outlines the remit of the overall operational management:

- responsible for the implementation of the relevant part of the British Red Cross Tactical Manager’s plan using appropriate tactics within their geographical or functional area of responsibility - aware of and understand the British Red Cross Tactical Manager’s plan and their own role within that plan
- arrange for adequate briefing of personnel using UK CR briefing procedures to establish they are aware of their roles and responsibilities within the tactical plan
- update the Tactical Manager on any changes including any variation in agreed tactics within their geographical or functional area of responsibility - be suitably located to maintain effective operational command of their geographic or functional area of responsibility
- record and manage operational risks, issues, actions and decisions in a log. A template RAID log can be used for this purpose and can be accessed by contacting the CR team. <!--TODO make template available here-->
- where necessary escalate and risks, issues, actions and decisions to the TCG or Tactical Manager, maintaining a clear audit trail.
- Where an operational manager is appointed, the above remit will be split between the Operational Manager, who is responsible for the delivery of the tactical plan and the Operational Team leader who is responsible for leading the team responding on the ground.
- For example, during the pandemic response, local operations were often coordinated by an operational coordination group (or ‘cell’), chaired by the Emergency Response Operations Manager or another appointed person, this person acted as Operational Manager. The Operational Team Leader(s) on scene took responsibility for their team and resources for the shift, briefing and debriefing and managing issues whilst they were on scene and then fed information up into the operational manager who managed the wider picture and represented the area at the tactical level meetings (UK Coordination Group).

## Command and control structure

- Gold - Strategic - What we are doing
- Silver - Tactical - How we are doing it
- Bronze - Operational - Doing it

The following command and control structure shows how our teams operate in any incident. The structure is scalable depending on the nature and size of the response.

The following pages details an organisational command and control structure for a large scale crisis. While this structure may be scaled down in a smaller incident, all roles and responsibilities should be considered.

The command and control structure aims to make it clear to everyone in the organisation, who is likely to be involved in a large scale crisis, how these roles interact, and the flow of information both vertically and horizontally throughout the British Red Cross. The command and control structure has been split into 3 key areas:

i. [how decisions are made in a crisis](#1-accountability-for-decision-making-in-a-crisis)
ii. [who is on the ground in a crisis](#2-who-is-on-the-ground-in-a-crisis)
iii. [vital crisis support in the background](#3-vital-crisis-support-in-the-background)

### i. Accountability for decision making in a crisis

Below are the roles and groups that are key to making decisions in a crisis.

|#|Role|Details|
|---|---|---|
|1| Strategic coordination group (SCG) – what we are doing | Sets the strategy and manages any risks, actions, issues and decisions being fed up from the TCG and any other supporting group or external environment/stakeholders. The group will consider questions such as, "is our response appropriate?", "is our appeal proving effective?" The SCG will ensure any decisions or actions are communicated back down to the TCG and any other relevant groups. Executive leaders will act on any requests for support with their directorates. <br><br> - Convened and chaired by the most appropriate person. <br><br> Attendees: <br> - relevant executive leaders <br> - relevant members of the strategic leadership team <br> - chair of the society action team (SAT) <br> - chair of the tactical coordination group (TCG) <br> - a loggist |
|2| Tactical coordination group (TCG) – how we are doing it | Group that meets regularly to make key tactical decisions on the ground. This group should act as a forum for response managers to discuss responses, manage risks and issues, problem solve and may include the following agenda items: <br> - Overview of new or current activity in response areas <br> - Management of risks, actions, issues and decisions (RAID log) reported by operational teams <br> - Items for escalation to the SCG or other people/groups <br> - Share learning and best practice from responses across the country <br> - Consider what additional resources should be deployed, <br> - Use of operational discretion (the deployment of resources without prior consent from a statutory agency) <br> - Ensure any decisions or actions are communicated back to operational teams <br><br> - Convened and chaired by most appropriate person. <br><br> Attendees: <br> - operational team leader <br> - crisis response (CR) manager or other CR team representative <br> - ER Operations managers (or other Response managers) <br> - strategic and engagement lead <br> - fundraising project manager <br> - communications and advocacy (C&A) project manager <br> - representatives from services providing specialist support (if appropriate), <br> - a loggist |
| 3  | Operational coordination group (OCG) - doing it         | These roles report into the tactical coordination group but should feel empowered to make key operational decisions on the ground. <br> - Convened by the operational team leader. <br> a. Role of operational team leader: Point of contact and coordinator on the ground for all staff and volunteers, including services providing specialist support. Where an incident is across multiple sites, is larger in scale, or is deemed necessary for operational spans of control, more than one operational team leader may be required. <br> b. Role of engagement lead: Conducting higher level needs and response assessments, this role is focused on engagement over the longer term and at a more strategic level. This role may be delivered on or off site. |
| 4  | Society action teams (SAT)                             | Group that meets to make key non-operational decisions about external communications, advocacy, and fundraising. This group uses standard operating procedures for fundraising and communications e.g., providing a recommendation regarding launching an appeal and/or media campaign. <br><br> - Convened and chaired the most appropriate person depending on the circumstances of the incident and the focus of the group. <br><br> Attendees: <br> - fundraising project manager <br> - C&A project manager <br> - crisis response manager <br> - representatives from teams in C&A and fundraising <br> - a loggist |
| 5  | Loggist   | The role of the loggist is to provide a supporting role to decision makers/groups by documenting key decisions/rationale and sharing information.                                        |
| 6  | Runner    | The role of the runner is to pass information on the ground between staff and volunteers if the response is operating over a large geographic area.                                        |

### ii. Who is on the ground in a crisis

### iv. Entire command and control structure

Below is the complete command and control structure showing how the three groups interact in a large scale incident.

<!-- TODO image-->

### Comamnd and Control levels

**In routine incidents, Level 1 and Level 2, the local area will implement a command and control structure. Dependent on the nature and scale of the response, the strategic and tactical roles may be combined and fulfilled by one person.**

|Level|Definition|What happens|
|---|---|---|
| Routine incidents | When a local area is responding to a routine incident that is not a notifiable incident (see notifiable incident quick card)| Local area maintains contact with relevant stakeholders as per local arrangements.|
| Level 1| When the incident meets any of the criteria of a notifiable incident but it is agreed by the CR team and local area that the immediate response can be managed by the local area team without additional support | • CR team maintains regular contact with local area and continues to monitor and assess the situation<br>• CR team alerts communications team<br>• Information is shared with the wider organisation through operational updates |
| Level 2| When the incident meets any of the criteria of a notifiable incident and CR team and local area identify that additional support is required| CR team offers support to the local area in the form of assistance via mutual aid, CRVs, corporate partnerships, specialist psychosocial support or other operational/supporting functions (see command and control structure for a full list) <!--TODO link--> |

**In Level 3 and Level 4 incidents, the command and control structure will be jointly agreed by the local area(s) and CR team.**

|Level|Definition|What happens|
|---|---|---|
| Level 3| When wider organisational coordination is needed. This may be triggered in responses that affect multiple/all areas/directorates, require an appeal, require a support line, or have continued national/international media interest | • The head of crisis response convenes a TCG. The TCG chair will report to an appointed director (CRCR/HLCR/RSRFLAT)<br>• A SAT may also be launched if needed |
| Level 4| When the organisation can no longer operate BAU without significant additional resources, there is considerable and prolonged media coverage and organisational risk has been identified by the TCG| • The executive director UK operations convenes a SCG<br>• Full command and control structure is implemented |
