## Crisis response – cost recovery matrix

||Spontaneous emergency responses – up to 72 hours| Spontaneous emergency responses – over 72 hours| Planned response A| Planned response B| Planned response C|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Examples| - Fire <br> - Flood <br> - Rest centres| - Fire <br> - Flood <br> - Rest centres| - Anti-trafficking <br> - Homelessness <br> - Distraction| - Psycho-social <br> - Winter pressures <br> - A+E discharge <br> - Training|- Utility companies|
Costs to be recovered|- N/A| - Direct costs| - Direct costs| - Direct costs + 10%|- Indirect costs <br> - Direct costs + 10%|

### Notes

1. In some major emergencies where it may be necessary to deploy senior British Red Cross personnel as lead roles in the response, we would seek to recover these costs.
2. Direct costs include the salaries of staff deployed who are not part of the regular Emergency Response staff teams.
3. Planned Response (B) – where appropriate we will also seek to recover a contribution towards indirect costs such as recruitment, training and premises.
