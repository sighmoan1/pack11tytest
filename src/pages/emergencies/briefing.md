Guidance on operational, tactical and strategic briefing in an emergency response.

## Introduction

Briefings are the most efficient and common means to present information to staff and volunteers or other specified audiences. Information can be given quickly, in a convenient location, and when there is a need to decide how to act on that information.

Typically, briefings are concise and do not include long discussions or complex decision making. Rather, they allow incident managers and commanders to communicate specific information and expectations for the upcoming response period and to answer questions.

Effective briefings that are reviewed as part of the debriefing process, with identified lessons that are acted upon, assist in organisational learning and development (and organisational memory).

Briefings are the main way staff and volunteers find out about our operational response to an incident. It is important that our commanders and responders understand what is required of them, when, and for how long.

## Consistency

To ensure consistency across the British Red Cross and with other agencies, the British Red Cross briefing model is based upon the College of Policing IIMARCH model (see following page for details). This model is also used in JESIP.

Tips:

- People care mostly about their own responsibilities and welfare but must receive other important information.
- Making briefings brief but complete is very important.
- Using a structure to plan a briefing will significantly improve it.
- Consider where to do the briefing: onsite/offsite (this could be a muster point or RVP).
- Operational commanders may attend a briefing and also deliver one.

## Delivery

ABC:

- Accuracy: If you don’t know, say so.
- Brevity: As brief as possible.
- Clarity: As clear as possible and check people’s understanding.

Tips:

- Plan and Prepare: know what you are going to say and how to deliver it. This can be practiced through exercises.
- Always check team understanding of the situation following a briefing.
- Always invite questions.

## Operational briefing

| IIMARCH model    |Operational Briefing|
|---|---|
| **Information**  | - Location details. The sites at which our operational responses will happen<br>- Operational timeline if known (especially for pre-planned events)<br>- What we currently know and what we need to find out<br>- Operational partners/other agencies involved in the response  |
| **Intention**    | - State what has happened: increase team members knowledge<br>- What is our approach|

| **Method**| - Invoke the tactical plan |
| **Administration**   | - Identify commanders<br> - Identify roles<br> - What are the operational policies?<br> - What is the location, what are the shift allocations, where and when will briefings be held, health and safety considerations? |
