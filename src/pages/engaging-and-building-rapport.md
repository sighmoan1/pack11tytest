  key: Engaging and building rapport
---

When you first meet the individuals impacted by the incident, and you have been introduced, it is helpful to build rapport with them in order to be able to help.  

CALMER gives us a framework and the questions below will help you to develop an approach that works for you. In some instances, just listening or being there is enough. When the time is right these questions or conversational starters are good examples that have helped in the past.  Do bear in mind however that the person affected might not be ready to have a conversation yet, and this is okay, it is part of our person centred approach for people to say ‘no’ or ‘no for now’. You can always circle back a little later.

Please do not use them parrot fashion but put them in your own words as the situation unfolds.

1. What is it that you need the most right now, how can I help? Is there anything you need from the house?
2. There is a lot we can do to help, but equally I’m OK if you just want some time to sit and think.
3. Is there anyone who you feel really understands you and is close to you that you would like to talk to right now?  
4. We understand this is a really difficult situation for you, would you like to tell me what is worrying you the most?
5. This must be hard for you? How are you feeling? If we found a way to work together to …………? Would that help?
6. Lets get a hot drink, then I’ll get an update from the fire crew, and after that we can start to work out what to do next, how does that sound?
7. The way you’re feeling is natural, re-gaining some control of the situation will help, why don’t we chat through what could be done?
8. Would it help if I ran through what will happen next, and the things we have found that have helped other people in your situation?
9. We are part of a much larger organisation and there are other resources we can signpost you to that can help with your (specific problem).
10. Coming out of this what are your best hopes of what will happen next?
