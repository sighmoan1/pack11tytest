1. Remember your aim is to help service users come to terms with the crisis and start to take control of their own situation.
2. Explain to service users how you can help.
3. Move service users to the safety and shelter of the ER vehicle if appropriate. Remember not to be alone with service users in the vehicle unless you're in view of others or the door is open.
4. Try to establish what their needs are [use the identifying needs prompt](/identifying-peoples-needs-at-an-incident). Remember not all needs are visible and the user may need encouragement and reassurance. Use the CALMER technique.
5. If you decide cash assistance is required:
    * it's £45 per day for each child or adult
    * there's a 3-day limit for cash assistance - £135 per person.
    * the maximum cash you can load on a card is £420
    * the maximum withdrawal at a bank machine is £35
    * the person you give the card to must be 18 years old
    * you can give a card to each adult in a household

    Call CRCC to activate the card, or to discuss vouchers and exceptional payments for accommodation.

6. Record useful information and actions taken including times, ETAs and contact numbers for insurance or other services on a 'What next?' form. Record contact details of service users for follow-ups.
7. Be alert to any safeguarding issues. Contact CRCC or report what you've observed direct to the safeguarding team: <a href="tel:03000040377">0300 004 0377</a>.
8. Use the incident log to keep track of any support, advice or items given.
