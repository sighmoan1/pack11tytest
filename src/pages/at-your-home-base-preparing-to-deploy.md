1. Pay attention to other vehicles when you arrive and park where your vehicle will not obstruct others.
2. Avoid disturbing fire crews who may be asleep.
3. Prepare your response vehicle:
    * carry out checks
    * switch on mobile phone
    * log in to the TomTom navigation system and enter the location
    * fill hot water flasks
    * remove electricity cable
    * turn on heating if needed
4. Discuss what you know about the incident with your shift partner - if you think you'll need more people or equipment, contact CRCC.
5. Use the Banksman system if you're reversing the vehicle day or night.
6. Call CRCC with an updated ETA based on the information from the TomTom and your local knowledge.
7. Start collating information for the incident report form.
