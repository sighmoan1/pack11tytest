1. Tell relevant people you're standing down, for example, CRCC, duty manager or incident commander.
2. Hand over relevant information and any concerns to a new shift if necessary and debrief in one or more of the following ways:
    * at the location with the operational team leader (known as a hot debrief)
    * in the vehicle with your partner on the way back to base - check how you're both feeling and whether you might need support
    * over the phone with CRCC or your duty manager
    * in the days following the incident with your line manager or team (known as a cold debrief)
3. Refuel if necessary (vehicle should be at least three-quarters full).
4. Be considerate when you arrive at base - people may be asleep.
5. Confirm you've returned safely with CRCC or your duty manager.
6. Complete the close-down checklist.
7. Photograph all What next? forms; complete incident report forms and send; record any accidents or near-misses on Datix (app on Redroom). [Click here to go to the Datix form](https://brc.gateway.prod-uk.datixcloudiq.co.uk/capture/?action=newdif1&module=INC).
8. If you need support or counselling call the confidential helpline operated by Health Assured on
