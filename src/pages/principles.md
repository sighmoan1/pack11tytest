  title: BRC Seven Fundamental Principles and the ER role
---

All services carried out by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are based on seven fundamental principles. This should shape your service provisions and behaviour whilst wearing the Red Cross emblem.

| Principle | What it means | How CER volunteers put this principle into action|
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Humanity      | To prevent and alleviate suffering; protect life and health. Ensure that people are treated with dignity and respect. | During the Covid 19 pandemic, ERVs across the country supported vulnerable people with food, medication, information, and by taking the time to listen and ensure people knew they were not alone. They even worked through other organisations like St John’s ambulance to make sure vaccines were accessible; always prioritising the needs of people in the community. |
| Impartiality  | No discrimination. Prioritising support based on needs. | When ERVs have been part of emergency welfare checks following power outages, we work with the power companies to prioritise their most vulnerable customers and to make sure that those individual circumstances are cared for based on need. |
| Neutrality    | We represent the movement when we wear the emblem. We don’t take sides. | ERVs were part of a movement – wide response to support UK nationals returning home after conflict began in Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territory. Working alongside psycho-social team specialists on the ground and on phonelines, we supported those arriving back in the UK. |
| Independence  | While we work with governments and partners, we always deliver within our principles and the law. | Where asylum seekers have been housed in hotels, especially following repatriation of Afghan citizens, ERVs have works alongside, but separate from, government agencies to make sure people have the support they need, from warm clothing to signposting that enables them to access services, including other parts of the BRC. |
| Voluntary service | We are part of a voluntary relief movement that is not prompted by desire for gain. | ERVs give their time to support their communities every day. In the weeks following Grenfell thousands of hours of time were given freely to support survivors, friends and family. And the wider community impacted by the tragedy. |
| Unity        | Each nation state has only one red Cross / Red Crescent society and it is open to everyone. | While we have local variations and projects, the essential core of our service is the same wherever you are in the UK – practical and emotional support to help people through a time of crisis, build resilience and promote recovery. |
