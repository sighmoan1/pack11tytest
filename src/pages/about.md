# Background

Welcome to the Crisis and Emergency Response Playbook.

The Crisis and Emergency Response Playbook has been developed by volunteers, for volunteers.

Building from the efforts of volunteers in the Thames Valley area lead by David Batup and Phil Osler, the playbook is the culmination of the feedback, reflections and ideas of volunteers from every area of the UK; enabling each other to in maintain a high level of support to service users as well to ourselves.  

In the Emergency Response field, it can be essential to keep skills fresh. The Playbook has been built by and will continue to be updated with the best practice of volunteers, BRC staff and working partners to provide a facility for shared learning. We hope that the Playbook will contribute to volunteerâ€™s confidence in providing the best support to those in crisis.  

Volunteers are encouraged to dip in and out of the Playbook to refresh learning or build confidence when needed.  

The Playbook is regularly reviewed to ensure that new ideas and situations are captured and shared.  

Huge thanks to all of the team members who have contributed to make the playbook into a concise and comprehensive resource to support deployment.
