# How to use this document

The ER Playbook has been developed to act as a quick guide for volunteers for each stage of a deployment.

The document is structured in 3 sections:

1. Pocket checklist
Short checklists to quickly scan through during the deployment at each stage, to remind us about the tasks to be carried out.

2. Phases of deployment
A more detailed summary of each stage of the deployment. Designed for us to review on the way to a deployment to remind us of the tasks to be carried out.

3. Background detail
Further detail on different topics that we may find useful during a deployment, designed for us to read and revise in our own time, outside of a deployment
