## Background

Welcome to the Crisis and Emergency Response Playbook.

The Crisis and Emergency Response Playbook has been developed by volunteers, for volunteers.

Building from the efforts of volunteers in the Thames Valley area lead by David Batup and Phil Osler, the playbook is the culmination of the feedback, reflections and ideas of volunteers from every area of the UK; enabling each other to in maintain a high level of support to service users as well to ourselves.  

In the Emergency Response field, it can be essential to keep skills fresh. The Playbook has been built by and will continue to be updated with the best practice of volunteers, BRC staff and working partners to provide a facility for shared learning. We hope that the Playbook will contribute to volunteer’s confidence in providing the best support to those in crisis.  

Volunteers are encouraged to dip in and out of the Playbook to refresh learning or build confidence when needed.  

The Playbook is regularly reviewed to ensure that new ideas and situations are captured and shared.  

Huge thanks to all of the team members who have contributed to make the playbook into a concise and comprehensive resource to support deployment.

~~1. Pocket checklist~~
~~Short checklists to quickly scan through during the deployment at each stage, to remind us about the tasks to be carried out.~~

~~2. Phases of deployment~~
~~A more detailed summary of each stage of the deployment. Designed for us to review on the way to a deployment to remind us of the tasks to be carried out.~~

## BRC Seven Fundamental Principles and the ER role

All services carried out by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are based on seven fundamental principles. This should shape your service provisions and behaviour whilst wearing the Red Cross emblem.

| Principle | What it means | How CER volunteers put this principle into action|
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Humanity      | To prevent and alleviate suffering; protect life and health. Ensure that people are treated with dignity and respect. | During the Covid 19 pandemic, ERVs across the country supported vulnerable people with food, medication, information, and by taking the time to listen and ensure people knew they were not alone. They even worked through other organisations like St John’s ambulance to make sure vaccines were accessible; always prioritising the needs of people in the community. |
| Impartiality  | No discrimination. Prioritising support based on needs. | When ERVs have been part of emergency welfare checks following power outages, we work with the power companies to prioritise their most vulnerable customers and to make sure that those individual circumstances are cared for based on need. |
| Neutrality    | We represent the movement when we wear the emblem. We don’t take sides. | ERVs were part of a movement – wide response to support UK nationals returning home after conflict began in Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territory. Working alongside psycho-social team specialists on the ground and on phonelines, we supported those arriving back in the UK. |
| Independence  | While we work with governments and partners, we always deliver within our principles and the law. | Where asylum seekers have been housed in hotels, especially following repatriation of Afghan citizens, ERVs have works alongside, but separate from, government agencies to make sure people have the support they need, from warm clothing to signposting that enables them to access services, including other parts of the BRC. |
| Voluntary service | We are part of a voluntary relief movement that is not prompted by desire for gain. | ERVs give their time to support their communities every day. In the weeks following Grenfell thousands of hours of time were given freely to support survivors, friends and family. And the wider community impacted by the tragedy. |
| Unity        | Each nation state has only one red Cross / Red Crescent society and it is open to everyone. | While we have local variations and projects, the essential core of our service is the same wherever you are in the UK – practical and emotional support to help people through a time of crisis, build resilience and promote recovery. |
