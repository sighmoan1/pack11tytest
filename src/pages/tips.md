The following hints and tips are intended to help volunteers get the most from this ER Playbook. The list is not in any particular order although, if you do chose to follow the list below, it will ensure you get off to a good start:

1. Develop a good understanding of the life cycle of a call out, from being prepared to responding to being back at your home base.
2. Practice your CALMER skills by using it as much as you can, this will help you and those you are helping. <!--TODO see the summary later in this document.-->
3. Attend a call out as an observer as soon as you can, all crews will welcome you along.
4. Donâ€™t run before you can walk. The help we give can be stressful in some situations, when you have been trained, team up on the schedule with experienced volunteers.
5. Regularly dip into this Playbook and take it along to your training sessions to put your training in context of the operational aspects of a call out.
6. Discuss the pages below, when you leave your home base, en-route to the call out with your crew mate to form an outline of a plan of what you are going to do:
    a. When arriving at the incident.
    b. During the incident.
7. If you are not sure about anything then ask as everyone is here to help you. No one will know you need help unless you ask.
8. Be very careful of giving advice or doing too much yourself. The goal is to assist those in crisis to a point where they have a plan and are capable and willing to take control of the situation, not to show how knowledgeable you are.
9. Arrive at the call out in a calm and professional way so that those who rely on you feel that you are confident. In turn, this will give them confidence in their ability to handle the situation.
10. You are part of a trusted and respected organisation, which has a very successful track record of giving help; please do all you can to continue this.
