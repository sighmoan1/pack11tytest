## Description

These are pre-duty activities. The rota link will be emailed to you, along with an updated contact sheet, a week or so before the next month. Check your diary to see what shifts you can commit to and enter onto the spread sheet. Also see “Rota commitment ……..” below. The rota is a dynamic document and you can sign up on the day or a day or two before.

## Communication

* Update the rota with any changes straight away.  Contact your crew partner before you are on duty.
* If you find you are on your own WhatsApp, text or email the team to see if anyone is available, see “Call out situations” below.

## CALMER – Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

Ask for help if needed.  Consider personal commitments (are you fit for duty?) and activities you might be doing the day or evening before to ensure your ability whilst on duty will not be compromised.

## Field Craft

* Add your availability to the rota as soon as possible, preferably the month before.
* Call if your partner has warned you they may not hear their text tone.
* Ensure there is good rota coverage.

## CRCR operational procedure

The Alerting Authority places a request with BRC Crisis Response Contact Centre (CRCC) for BRC ER assistance. CRCC then send out a Flare and or an Assemble request to the nearest operational ER crew to the incident. If no crew responds, further messages will be sent out to adjacent teams teams.  

If no crews are available, CRCC will consider, if appropriate, “Lone Responding” with specifically trained and risk assessed volunteers or telephone support.

## Call-out situations (local procedures may differ)
<!-- TODO images-->
There are 5 core call-out situations. These are below along with guidance on to how to respond. If you are ever in doubt then contact your ERO or the BRC DM for advice. The Alerting Authority will pass the call out to another area team if there is no response after 30mins of the first text requesting assistance.

### SDriver and Crew are on the Rota

* Contact your crew mate to check that you are both OK to go.
* Call CRCC to advise you are on your way.
* Make your way to your home base and the ER Vehicle.

### You are on you own, on the Rota (Driver or crew)

* Text/WhatsApp the ER Volunteers before your shift to try and get someone to cover the shift with you.
* If a call out comes through and one person is on the rota, available volunteers should contact the rota’d volunteer.

### No one is on the Rota (you only have 30 mins from CRCC text)

* Send out your own group text or WhatsApp  to ER Volunteers.
* If a BRC DM or CRCC sends a flare <!--TODO (like above)-->, let the BRC DM & CRCC know you are available. Don’t leave home until you have a crew mate.

### You would like to attend as a 3rd person

* Call or text the driver and crew before the shift starts, to let them know this is what you would like to do.

### There is an emergency response flare

* If you can attend then call the number given stating your name, number and availability.
