5. [During the incident](/lifecycle/5-during-the-incident)
6. [Leaving and post call-out](/lifecycle/6-leaving-and-post-call-out/)

## Description

The key to this stage is ensuring you are prepared, and that you do your last minute checks. These should include checking the rota in case there has been any change and driving safely to your home base.

## Communication

* Last minute check of rota
* Call your partner when a call out comes through
* Agree who will respond to CRCC to confirm that you are responding.
* Be aware of alternative procedures (no-one on rota or one person on rota), see “Call out Situations”.

## CALMER – Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

* The text message system will give you some information regarding the call out.
* Put your safety first and ‘drive-to-arrive’ when driving to your home base
* Consider your personal state of mind (Concerned, angry, upset etc.) regarding your fitness to respond

## Field Craft

* Check traffic/weather reports that might affect your route to your home base.  Live Traffic Info app from Highways Agency is good to use.
* Have - Work wear, ID, FOB, PPE ready – grab bag.
* Talk to each other, work out who is going to call CRCC (typically the Driver) and approximate ETA to home base.
* Be prepared to be re-directed e.g. Hospital, a relative’s house or stood down.

## Engaging with service users

Think through how you will meet the service users:

* Ask CRCC if they have any further info about service users.
* Keep an open mind.
* Don’t assume.
* Less is more (stick to the facts).

## Health and Safety

* We are not an emergency service – ‘drive to arrive’.
* If your mobile phone goes off whilst driving, pull over or let your crew mate take the call.
* Are you in a good position to respond e.g. have you been drinking (the recommended period of abstinence is 12 hours) or are you exhausted etc.?

## Collaboration with other services

One of you calls the CRCC to tell them you are responding and that you will call to advise of your ETA once you have left your home base in the ER vehicle.

## Tools, resources and reporting

* Check the Google based Rota.
* Each vehicle has a smart phone onboard.  This should be turned on and used for all calls whilst responding.

## Looking after you and team work

* If you have a problem en-route to your home base, call your partner as soon as possible.
* Put yourself first.
* Make a decision as to whether you can continue, liaise with crew & CRCC (stand down likely).
