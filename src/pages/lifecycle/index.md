  key: Lifecycle of a call-out
---

This is an overview of the ER Call out Lifecycle. These pages will give you summary information to remind you of what to do on a call out, giving you an insight into best practice. Each step is supported by a one-page description. This information is based on the experience of ER volunteers and is intended as a supplement to your training and development for both new and experienced volunteers.

The life cycle starts with you volunteering for shifts on the rota, and ends with your arrival back at your home base after a call out. This Playbook is something to dip into rather than trying to read it from cover to cover. It is especially useful to support you on your way to a call out and while you are involved at the incident.

One overarching principle that should shape what you do whilst on duty and in work wear, is that you are representing the Red Cross, not yourself. In helping those in crisis, you are providing a Red Cross service.
