## Description

Whilst this stage seems a bit obvious, it is fraught with problems if not approached in a calm and considered way. This is equally applicable to the way you conduct yourselves at your home base and when you leave in the ER vehicle.

## Communication

* Check your phone for potential stand-down message.
* Call CRCC using the ER vehicle phone when leaving to get any further information & to inform you are on your way and your E.T.A, see TomTom.

## CALMER – Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

* Discuss what you know and start to form a plan of what you will do when you get to the incident, this will help with your confidence.
* Watch each other’s welfare, talk about your feelings and state.
* Are you both in a good place? If not discuss and if needed use the vehicle phone to get advice.

## Field Craft

* Use Fob if required to gain access to home-base/vehicle - retrieve keys.
* Do vehicle checks and log into TomTom and enter address.
* Fill hot water flasks if necessary.
* Take electricity cable out of vehicle.
* Before departure check the vehicle interior is secure and switch on the heating, if needed.
* Turn on the vehicle mobile phone, this must remain on the crewmember’s person at all times.
* ID must remain on your person at all times.
* Call CRCC to let them know you have left.

## Engaging with service users
