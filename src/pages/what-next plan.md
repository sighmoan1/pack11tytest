![What next document](/images/what-next.png)

This plan is designed to be used by the individuals that have been impacted by the incident. It is important they take responsibility for it an its completion. This plan is particularly useful when used with the “What Next” leaflet that many teams use. The guidelines below are for ER Volunteers who can, and do facilitate the creation of the plan.

## The benefits of the plan are

* It helps the service users take control of the situation and do something positive both enabling and empowering
* It gives the Service users one place to collect information and record calls and conversations etc
* It's structured to help them think about the things they are going to need, important documents and stuff to do
* They have a plan to keep and use the following day rather than trying to remember everything
* It helps us focus on them as individuals rather than thinking through the practicalities of the situation. Clearly, we still need to do this but it becomes more of a shared process with the Service users and supports the transition to them taking ownership and responsibility
* It supports the CALMER approach
* Before we leave we could take a photo of the plan to help us, in future, re follow-up, changes to process and approach

## Guidelines

* Not everyone will welcome or be able to cope with the concept of a plan, as such be careful how you introduce it.
* Use your own judgement of the situation as to when to use it
* The best outcome is, the service user not only accepts the need to plan but also is happy to use and complete the What-Next form themselves
* Encourage the service user to capture information as it is found or given as well as keeping a log of calls and events on the back of the form
* Be careful of taking ownership of the plan, by all means help but avoid it becoming something you do and therefore not really theirs
* Have a plastic wallet they can keep the plan in along with other key documents and bits of paper
* Put your Managers office contact details at the bottom of the first page if they would like to have a BRC contact, never yours, unless you are the Manager.
