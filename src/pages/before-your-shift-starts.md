Consider whether you're in the right physical and mental shape to respond. If you've been drinking alcohol, taking new or strong medication or are not feeling up to it, tell your team you're not available.

**To get ready for your shift you should:**

1. prepare your workwear and other personal protective equipment (PPE), and check your grab bag of essential items
2. have your ID, FOB (electronic key to the fire station) and access codes to hand
3. check your personal vehicle is fuelled and ready
4. tell people you live with that you may be leaving the house without notice
5. charge your phone and leave it switched on
6. if you're on a rota with a specific partner, agree who will respond to any CRCC requests to deploy
