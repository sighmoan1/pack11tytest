Our partners will request the support of BRC ER following an assessment of the situation. These are some hints and tips that could help them, and others impacted by the emergency.

## CRCC

As a volunteer, you should let CRCC know:

* That you are available to respond/deploy.
* That you are on your way to your home base.
* Your ETA once you have left your home base.
* When you have arrived at the incident.
* When you are leaving.
* When you have returned to your home base.
* Any significant developments e.g. possible crime scene.

## Lead Agency

The Lead Agency is the agency on scene that is responsible for coordinating the incident.

* Knowing that you are available often gives the lead agency confidence in requesting the BRC ER Team.
* Make sure you sign in with the lead agency when you arrive at the incident and understand your role at the incident.
* Be one of the conduits for information between the Lead Agency and the service users.
* Assist where requested in getting the service users away from the incident scene and into a safe place.
* Make all requests for information or help via your OTL to the Lead Agency Incident Manager.
* Provide feedback to the OTL from any observations on scene or reports from service users.

## Other Agencies

* Ensure other agencies understand our offer and scope of operations.  Particularly the ability to ramp up our operations to a national level of support if required.
* Understand the roles and scope of other agencies.
* Signpost to the best organisation to support the service users
* In collaboration, support getting the service users away from the incident and into a safe place.

These are the type of Tabards you are most likely to see at an incident.  They identify the organisation and role of wearer.
