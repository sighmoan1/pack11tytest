3. Approach the location with caution. When you arrive find out from other responders where to park.
4. Make sure your ID is visible and you're wearing appropriate clothing and PPE, for example, hi-visibility jackets. Consider whether you'll need to use radios.
5. Call CRCC to provide a risk assessment of:
    * any hazards you've identified
    * people who might be in danger as a result
    * if there are adequate precautions to protect those people and anything further that would ensure their safety
6. Report to the control point and get briefed by the incident commander or operational team leader (OTL). If the responders have left check for a handover document.
