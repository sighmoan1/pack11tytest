1. Check for updates and possible STAND DOWN instruction from CRCC.
2. Talk through your response plan including how you'll carry out the dynamic risk assessment and engage with service users
3. Approach the location with caution. When you arrive find out from other responders where to park.
4. Make sure your ID is visible and you're wearing appropriate clothing and PPE, for example, hi-visibility jackets. Consider whether you'll need to use radios.
5. Call CRCC to provide a risk assessment of:
    * any hazards you've identified
    * people who might be in danger as a result
    * if there are adequate precautions to protect those people and anything further that would ensure their safety
6. Report to the control point and get briefed by the incident commander or operational team leader (OTL). If the responders have left check for a handover document.
7. Ask the incident commander to introduce you to service users. If you cannot locate service users contact CRCC or the duty manager.

## Description

* Approach with caution and take direction from responding agencies if they are present as to where to park.
* Report to the control point and get a briefing and an introduction to service users from the Incident Commander. If the responding agencies have left, check to see if any handover information has been left for the ER team.

## Communication

* Advise CRCC you have arrived at the call out through the ER vehicle mobile.
* If you cannot locate the service users, ask the CRCC if they know where they are.
Duty of care is with the CRCC and/or BRC DM.

## CALMER – Consider, Acknowledge, Listen, Manage, Enable, Resource

* Consider potential risks to yourself, and other people’s unique needs and wishes.
* Consider your crew mate(s) – discuss your reaction (feelings) to the incident scene, pay attention to each other regarding how you are both coping.
* When meeting the service users listen more than you talk and demonstrate you are listening, acknowledge their concerns.

## Field Craft

* Park where advised (or in a safe place with a clear exit facing the direction in which you can leave).
* First impressions are important both for other Emergency Responders and the people you have come to help. Being smart, confident and adopting an open style will help them build confidence in you.
* Discuss and plan initial steps e.g. service limitations, who does what.

## Engaging with service users

* Have ID visibly available.
* Introduce yourselves and explain why you are here and the help you can offer.
* Identify those in need – don’t assume it is only the people you have been introduced to.
* Be very careful with your first impressions, avoid assumptions and don’t make any promises.

## Health and Safety

* Wear Hi-Vis jackets and other PPE as appropriate.
* Watch out for Emergency Response equipment.
* If possible move individuals to the safety and shelter of the ER vehicle.
* Discuss and carry out a dynamic risk assessment throughout the incident.
* Be aware of cordon & incident ground procedures.

## Collaboration with other services

* Register attendance with the command point.
* Get a briefing from the Incident Commander as to the situation, help required and safety advice. Introduce yourself to any other emergency responders present. Be aware of cordon requirements.
* If you cannot locate service users contact CRCC or incident commander to see if they know their location e.g. neighbours, friends or hospital.

## Tools, resources and reporting

* Note time of arrival on the incident report.
* Have the incident report to hand.
* Start to keep a log of advice and help given.

## Looking after you and team work

* Stick together as a team.
* Watch out for each other in terms of needs and the demands or risks placed on each other.
* Personal protective equipment – put on Hi-Vis jacket & know where helmets are.
* If your vehicle carries radios, consider switching them on (on the same channel) and carry them with you along with the Vehicle mobile.
