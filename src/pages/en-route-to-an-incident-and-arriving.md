1. Check for updates and possible STAND DOWN instruction from CRCC.
2. Talk through your response plan including how you'll carry out the dynamic risk assessment and engage with service users
3. Approach the location with caution. When you arrive find out from other responders where to park.
4. Make sure your ID is visible and you're wearing appropriate clothing and PPE, for example, hi-visibility jackets. Consider whether you'll need to use radios.
5. Call CRCC to provide a risk assessment of:
    * any hazards you've identified
    * people who might be in danger as a result
    * if there are adequate precautions to protect those people and anything further that would ensure their safety
6. Report to the control point and get briefed by the incident commander or operational team leader (OTL). If the responders have left check for a handover document.
7. Ask the incident commander to introduce you to service users. If you cannot locate service users contact CRCC or the duty manager.
