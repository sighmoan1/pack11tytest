These five descriptions shown below are examples of difficult situations you may face. Most call outs result in a positive outcome in the sense that those in crisis are safe, have taken responsibility for their plan-of-action, and have somewhere to stay for the night. These call outs were more challenging and tested the crews on duty, however we hope that how they went about the challenges may provide insights for the situations you may face.

## Situation 1

Family in private rental accommodation destroyed by fire and/or water damage. No one to stay with, no insurance

## Challenges (Situation 1)

* No insurance.

* No friends or relatives for support.

* Contacting landlord.

## ER response (Situation 1)

* Provide items and/or cash assistance and signpost to organisations that may be able to provide donated items.

* Try to contact the landlord to see if their insurance covers temporary accommodation. If temporary accommodation cannot be provided by friends, family, landlord, or local authority emergency housing, we can provide accommodation for up to three nights.

* Provide extensive emotional support in light of the fact that they have no support network.

## Situation 2

Someone died at an incident or was seriously injured

## ER response (Situation 3)

## ER response (Situation 4)
